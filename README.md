## About the Project

This project was to create a program that was capable of generating stat blocks for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (DnD 5e) character sheets.
Stat blocks can be generated in a multitude of ways so this projects aim was to make it more accessable to people.

## Motivation

As we both play DnD 5e alot, this was our attempt to steamline the process of selecting and rolling for stats
