## About the Project

This project was to create a program that was capable of generating stat blocks for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (DnD 5e) character sheets.
Stat blocks can be generated in a multitude of ways so this projects aim was to make it more accessable to people.

## Motivation

As we both play DnD 5e alot, this was our attempt to steamline the process of selecting and rolling for stats as well as stated before
to make this more accessable for people

## Installation

Make sure Java is installed onto the computer where you wish to use the program. Download the "diceroller.jar" file inside the 
/diceroller/out/artifacts folder. Run the jar file and the program will launch

## Usage

The application works by default, the standard array of stats for DnD are shown with all 6 assignment choices preselected.

From there, click which method you would like to use to generate stats. Release v1.0 has 4 options, Standard Array, Roll 4D6 and drop the 
lowest roll, Roll 4D6 but reroll all 1s once, and Roll 4D6 and reroll the two lowest rolls - taking the higher of what was rolled.

From there, select what stats need to be assigned to what values that were rolled and click the "Export Stats to File" Button to
have the program either create a new file with the stats names "Stats Generated.txt" or ammend the file with the new roll
if it already exists.
